Overview
========

My modest attempt at providing a Clojure-engine that is compliant with JSR 223
(the Java Scripting API), which makes it possible to interchangably use any
scripting-engine for which an implementation exists.

Implemetations exist for example for JS, Groovy, Scala, and I think Clojure
should not be left out.

Since I included parts of clojure.lang.Repl and use classes from
clojure.lang.*, all stuff is under the CPL (see CPL.txt).
